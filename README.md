sshman --- an ssh connection manager for emacs
==============================================

Bout of madness. Amounts to me getting carried away with me getting
carried away with my emacs configuration file. Its integrated with
helm, so at this point there are small functions which, provided a
hardcoded list of hosts

* connect to a host, selected with helm;
* switch to a current connection, also selected with helm;

To do:

* A "nice" way to specify host lists (possibly with custom switches);
* Integrate file editing with tramp;
* Logging;
